# CLI Extension Type Design

**Date:** 2026-03-30
**Status:** Approved

## Context

A wave of agent-oriented CLI tools (wecom-cli, lark-cli, dingtalk dws, meitu-cli, OfficeCLI, CLI-Anything) has emerged as a new extension paradigm for AI coding agents. These CLIs are distinct from MCP servers and pure skills: they are installable binaries that ship with SKILL.md files teaching agents how to invoke them. HarnessKit currently tracks four extension kinds (Skill, Mcp, Plugin, Hook) and needs a fifth — CLI — to manage this growing category.

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| What CLI represents | The binary itself, as a parent entity of its associated skills |
| Discovery mechanism | Dual-path: reverse discovery from SKILL.md `requires.bins` + known CLI registry scan |
| CLI-Skill relationship | Hard link via `cli_parent_id` field; cascade enable/disable/delete |
| Inclusion criteria | Only agent-oriented CLIs — the CLI vendor must ship official agent integration (see Inclusion Criteria section) |
| Audit dimensions | Credential storage, network access, binary source, permission scope, aggregate risk |
| List UI treatment | Uniform columns with all other kinds; CLI-specific info in detail view only |

## Inclusion Criteria: What Makes a CLI "Agent-Oriented"

The criterion is not "does an agent use this CLI" but **"did the CLI vendor build agent integration"**.

An agent-oriented CLI is one where the vendor themselves provides:
- Official SKILL.md files (with `requires.bins` pointing to themselves), OR
- An agent skills installation mechanism (e.g., `install-skills.sh`, `npx skills add`), OR
- Agent-specific features (e.g., `dws schema` for runtime tool discovery), OR
- A built-in MCP server mode alongside the CLI

Traditional CLIs like `gh`, `aws`, `docker`, `kubectl` are NOT agent-oriented CLIs even though agents use them daily. The key difference: their vendors (GitHub, AWS, Google, Kubernetes) have not shipped official SKILL.md files or agent integration layers. If a third party writes a skill that references `gh` via `requires.bins`, that does not make `gh` an agent CLI — the skill author is not the CLI vendor.

**The KNOWN_CLIS registry codifies this editorial judgment.** The `requires.bins` reverse-discovery mechanism helps surface new candidates, but a CLI is only recognized as an agent-oriented extension when it meets the vendor-ships-agent-integration criterion (either by being in KNOWN_CLIS or by shipping its own SKILL.md with self-referencing `requires.bins`).

## 1. Data Model

### Rust (models.rs)

**ExtensionKind** gains a `Cli` variant:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Serialize, Deserialize)]
#[serde(rename_all = "lowercase")]
pub enum ExtensionKind {
    Skill,
    Mcp,
    Plugin,
    Hook,
    Cli,
}
```

**New struct — CliMeta:**

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct CliMeta {
    pub binary_name: String,
    pub binary_path: Option<String>,
    pub install_method: Option<String>,   // npm | pip | curl | brew | manual
    pub credentials_path: Option<String>,
    pub version: Option<String>,
    pub api_domains: Vec<String>,
}
```

**Extension struct** adds two fields:

```rust
pub struct Extension {
    // ... existing fields unchanged ...
    pub cli_parent_id: Option<String>,  // child skill → parent CLI
    pub cli_meta: Option<CliMeta>,      // only populated when kind == Cli
}
```

### TypeScript (types.ts)

```typescript
export type ExtensionKind = "skill" | "mcp" | "plugin" | "hook" | "cli";

export interface CliMeta {
  binary_name: string;
  binary_path: string | null;
  install_method: string | null;
  credentials_path: string | null;
  version: string | null;
  api_domains: string[];
}

export interface Extension {
  // ... existing fields unchanged ...
  cli_parent_id: string | null;
  cli_meta: CliMeta | null;
}
```

### DashboardStats

Both Rust `DashboardStats` and TypeScript `ExtensionCounts` gain a `cli_count` / `cli` field.

## 2. Scanner / Discovery

### New function: scan_cli_binaries()

Runs once per scan cycle (global, not per-adapter).

**Phase 1 — Reverse discovery from installed skills:**

Parse SKILL.md frontmatter for `metadata.requires.bins` (per the Agent Skills spec used by wecom-cli, lark-cli, dws, meitu). Also regex-match skill content for known binary invocation patterns as fallback.

Example frontmatter:
```yaml
---
name: wecomcli-send-message
description: Send messages via WeChat Work
metadata:
  requires:
    bins: ["wecom-cli"]
---
```

**Phase 2 — Known CLI registry scan:**

Hardcoded registry of agent-oriented CLIs:

```rust
struct KnownCli {
    binary_name: &'static str,
    display_name: &'static str,
    api_domains: &'static [&'static str],
    credentials_path: Option<&'static str>,
}

const KNOWN_CLIS: &[KnownCli] = &[
    KnownCli {
        binary_name: "wecom-cli",
        display_name: "WeChat Work CLI",
        api_domains: &["qyapi.weixin.qq.com"],
        credentials_path: Some("~/.config/wecom/bot.enc"),
    },
    KnownCli {
        binary_name: "lark-cli",
        display_name: "Lark / Feishu CLI",
        api_domains: &["open.feishu.cn", "open.larksuite.com"],
        credentials_path: Some("~/.config/lark/credentials"),
    },
    KnownCli {
        binary_name: "dws",
        display_name: "DingTalk Workspace CLI",
        api_domains: &["api.dingtalk.com"],
        credentials_path: Some("~/.config/dws/auth.json"),
    },
    KnownCli {
        binary_name: "meitu",
        display_name: "Meitu CLI",
        api_domains: &["openapi.mtlab.meitu.com"],
        credentials_path: Some("~/.meitu/credentials.json"),
    },
    KnownCli {
        binary_name: "officecli",
        display_name: "OfficeCLI",
        api_domains: &[],
        credentials_path: None,
    },
];
```

**Combined flow:**

1. Collect candidate binary names (Phase 1 `requires.bins` ∪ Phase 2 `KNOWN_CLIS`)
2. For each candidate:
   - `which <binary>` → binary_path (None if not found)
   - `<binary> --version` → version (None on failure)
   - Look up KNOWN_CLIS for supplementary metadata
   - Build CliMeta
   - Auto-derive permissions from CliMeta:
     - `api_domains` → `Permission::Network { domains }`
     - `credentials_path` → `Permission::FileSystem { paths }`
     - binary exists → `Permission::Shell { commands: [binary_name] }`
   - Create Extension with `kind: Cli`
3. Back-fill: set `cli_parent_id` on all skills whose `requires.bins` matches

**Stable ID:** `cli_stable_id(binary_name)` uses `"cli::{binary_name}"` as the hash input (not agent-scoped, since CLIs are global).

### scan_all modification

```rust
pub fn scan_all(adapters, store) -> Vec<Extension> {
    let mut all = vec![];

    // Existing: scan each adapter
    for adapter in adapters {
        all.extend(scan_skill_dir(...));
        all.extend(scan_mcp_servers(...));
        all.extend(scan_hooks(...));
        all.extend(scan_plugins(...));
    }

    // New: scan CLIs (global, once)
    let clis = scan_cli_binaries(&all);

    // Back-fill cli_parent_id on child skills
    for ext in &mut all {
        if ext.kind == ExtensionKind::Skill {
            if let Some(cli) = find_parent_cli(&clis, ext) {
                ext.cli_parent_id = Some(cli.id.clone());
            }
        }
    }

    all.extend(clis);
    all
}
```

### SKILL.md frontmatter parsing enhancement

Existing `scan_skill_dir` parses `name` and `description` from frontmatter. Add parsing of `metadata.requires.bins` (a string array). If the field is absent, fall back to regex content matching against known binary names.

## 3. Store (SQLite)

### Schema changes

```sql
ALTER TABLE extensions ADD COLUMN cli_parent_id TEXT REFERENCES extensions(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
ALTER TABLE extensions ADD COLUMN cli_meta_json TEXT;
```

`ON DELETE SET NULL`: deleting a CLI orphans child skills (sets their cli_parent_id to null) rather than cascading a database delete. Actual cascade deletion is handled by the Manager layer.

### New methods

```rust
fn get_child_skills(&self, cli_id: &str) -> Result<Vec<Extension>>
fn link_skills_to_cli(&self, cli_id: &str, skill_ids: &[String]) -> Result<()>
fn unlink_cli_children(&self, cli_id: &str) -> Result<()>
```

### Existing method adaptations

- **insert_extension**: write `cli_parent_id` and `cli_meta_json`; preserve user-set fields on conflict
- **list_extensions**: kind filter supports `"cli"`; add optional `cli_parent_id` filter parameter
- **sync_extensions**: CLI participates in sync (scanned → keep, not scanned → stale)
- **get_dashboard_stats**: add `cli_count`

### Migration

On Store initialization, check whether `cli_parent_id` column exists. If not, run ALTER TABLE. Consistent with the existing `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` pattern.

## 4. Auditor

### AuditInput extension

```rust
pub struct AuditInput {
    // ... existing fields ...
    pub cli_meta: Option<CliMeta>,
    pub child_skills: Vec<Extension>,
}
```

### 5 new audit rules (CLI-only)

**CliCredentialStorage (High)**
- Check credentials file permissions (should be 0600, not 0644+)
- Detect plaintext vs encrypted credential files
- Flag unknown credential storage location for CLIs known to require auth

**CliNetworkAccess (Medium)**
- Report connected external API domains from `api_domains`
- Flag when domain count > 3 (broad network surface)

**CliBinarySource (High)**
- npm/pip from official registry → more trusted
- curl (direct binary download) → higher risk
- binary_path outside standard locations → flag anomaly
- Unknown install method → flag "unknown source"

**CliPermissionScope (Medium)**
- Analyze child skills' descriptions to count business domains covered (contacts, messaging, calendar, docs, etc.)
- Flag when domain count > 5 (broad business permissions)

**CliAggregateRisk (Medium/High)**
- Collect all child skills' permissions (Network + Shell + FileSystem)
- Detect risky combinations: "read contacts" skill + "send messages" skill → potential data exfiltration channel
- Flag when individual child trust_scores are high but combined permission scope is broad

### Scoring

Standard deduction model: base 100, subtract by severity (Critical -25, High -15, Medium -8, Low -3). Maps to existing TrustTier (Safe 80+, LowRisk 60-79, NeedsReview 0-59).

## 5. Manager (Lifecycle)

### toggle_cli

```rust
fn toggle_cli(&self, ext: &Extension, enabled: bool) -> Result<()> {
    let children = self.store.get_child_skills(&ext.id)?;
    for child in &children {
        self.toggle_skill(child, enabled)?;
        self.store.set_enabled(&child.id, enabled)?;
    }
    self.store.set_enabled(&ext.id, enabled)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

Disabling a CLI cascades to all child skills. The binary itself is not touched — agents lose awareness because the SKILL.md files are disabled.

### delete_cli

Deletes all child skills (reusing existing skill deletion logic), then removes the CLI record from the database. Does NOT uninstall the binary — that is the user's responsibility via their package manager.

### install_cli

CLI installation does NOT use Install from Git. Unlike skills (which are Markdown files that work after a simple git clone), CLIs are compiled binaries with diverse installation methods (npm, curl, pip, etc.). Git clone yields source code that most users cannot build without the right toolchain.

Instead, each CLI has its own `install_command` stored in the registry:

| CLI | install_command |
|-----|----------------|
| wecom-cli | `npm install -g @wecom/cli` |
| lark-cli | `npm install -g @larksuite/cli` |
| dws | `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../install.sh \| sh` |
| meitu-cli | `npm install -g meitu-cli` |
| OfficeCLI | `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../install.sh \| bash` |

**Install flow:**
1. User clicks Install on a CLI marketplace entry
2. UI shows the exact install command and asks for confirmation (system-level operation)
3. Execute `install_command` to install the binary
4. Install associated skills: `npx skills add <skills_repo>` or repo-specific `install-skills.sh`
5. Trigger `scan_and_sync` to discover the new CLI + child skills

## 6. Tauri Commands (IPC)

### New commands

```rust
get_cli_with_children(cli_id: String) -> (Extension, Vec<Extension>)
toggle_cli(cli_id: String, enabled: bool) -> ()
delete_cli(cli_id: String) -> ()
install_cli(binary_name: String, install_command: String, skills_repo: String, target_agents: Vec<String>) -> ()
```

### Existing commands

Zero or minimal changes. `toggle_extension` and `delete_extension` delegate to Manager which handles CLI cascade internally. `list_extensions`, `get_dashboard_stats`, `run_audit`, `scan_and_sync` all work through the existing kind-aware plumbing.

## 7. Frontend

### KindBadge

Add CLI entry: orange color scheme, label "CLI", title "Agent-oriented CLI tool — binary + skills bundle".

CSS variable `--kind-cli` defined in `index.css` (orange, filling the gap in the existing blue/purple/green/red palette).

### Extensions page — list view

CLI entries use the exact same column structure as all other kinds:
- Kind badge (CLI, orange)
- Name
- Permission tags (Network / FileSystem / Shell — auto-derived from CliMeta)
- Trust score badge
- Toggle switch

No separate section or special columns.

### Extensions page — detail view

When a CLI entry is selected, the detail panel shows CLI-specific info:
- CliMeta: binary_path, version, install_method, credentials_path, api_domains
- Child skills list (individually toggleable only when the parent CLI is enabled; when CLI is disabled, all children are force-disabled)
- Audit findings
- Cascade toggle hint: "This will also disable N associated skills"

### Overview page

New CLI count stat card alongside existing skill/mcp/plugin/hook cards.

### Audit page

No structural changes. CLI audit findings enter the same results list.

### invoke.ts

New wrappers for `get_cli_with_children` and `install_cli`. Existing `toggleExtension` and `deleteExtension` unchanged — backend handles cascade.

### Extension store

- Kind filter gains `"cli"` option
- CLI extensions do not participate in cross-agent grouping (they are global)
- New getter: `childSkillsOf(cliId)` filters skills by `cli_parent_id`

## 8. Marketplace — CLI Section

The existing marketplace has two data sources: skills.sh (skills) and Smithery (MCP servers). A third section — **CLI Tools** — is added, powered by HarnessKit's own curated registry.

### Data source: HarnessKit CLI Registry

Since no authoritative agent CLI marketplace exists yet, HarnessKit maintains its own registry. Entries are added via two channels:

**Channel 1 — Manual curation:**
A hardcoded list of vetted agent-oriented CLI packages, maintained in the codebase as a static registry (similar to KNOWN_CLIS but with marketplace metadata: description, install command, skills repo, icon, categories).

**Channel 2 — Automated GitHub discovery (daily scan):**
A scheduled scan searches GitHub for new agent-oriented CLI repos using these rules:

| Rule | Signal Strength | Description |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| Repo contains SKILL.md with `requires.bins` referencing its own binary | Strong | Vendor ships agent integration for their own CLI |
| Repo has `install-skills.sh` or equivalent agent skills installer | Strong | Dedicated agent skills installation mechanism |
| Repo topics include `agent-skills`, `agent-cli`, `claude-code`, etc. | Medium | GitHub topic tags |
| README mentions "CLI" + ("Agent Skills" or "SKILL.md" or "Claude Code" or "Cursor") | Medium | Content keyword combination |

**Match logic:** At least 1 strong signal, OR 2+ medium signals → enters candidate queue. Candidates require human review before being published to the marketplace. This ensures quality while automating discovery.

### Marketplace UI

The marketplace page gains a third tab/section alongside "Skills" and "MCP Servers":

- **CLI Tools** tab
- Shows curated + approved CLI packages
- Each entry displays: name, description, install command, child skills count, categories, verified badge (for manually curated entries)
- Install flow: user selects target agents → confirms system command (e.g., `npm install -g @wecom/cli`) → installs CLI binary → installs associated skills → triggers scan

### Rust backend

```rust
// New in marketplace.rs

/// Curated CLI registry entry
pub struct CliRegistryEntry {
    pub binary_name: String,
    pub display_name: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub install_command: String,       // e.g., "npm install -g @wecom/cli"
    pub skills_repo: String,           // e.g., "WecomTeam/wecom-cli" (skills may be in same repo or separate, e.g., "meitu/meitu-skills")
    pub skills_install_command: Option<String>, // override for non-standard skills install (e.g., "curl ... | sh" for dws)
    pub icon_url: Option<String>,
    pub categories: Vec<String>,
    pub verified: bool,                // true for manually curated
    pub api_domains: Vec<String>,
    pub credentials_path: Option<String>,
}

/// Returns all CLI entries for the marketplace
pub fn list_cli_registry() -> Vec<MarketplaceItem>

/// GitHub discovery: search for candidate repos (daily cron)
pub fn discover_cli_candidates() -> Result<Vec<CliCandidate>>
```

### Tauri commands

```rust
list_cli_marketplace() -> Vec<MarketplaceItem>      // curated + approved entries
discover_cli_candidates() -> Vec<CliCandidate>       // for admin/review UI (future)
```

### Frontend

```typescript
// marketplace-store.ts
cliItems: MarketplaceItem[]
fetchCliMarketplace: () => Promise<void>

// invoke.ts
export const listCliMarketplace = () =>
  invoke<MarketplaceItem[]>("list_cli_marketplace");
```
